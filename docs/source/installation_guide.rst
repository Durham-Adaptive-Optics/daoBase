  compilation terminated.

This is caused by the wrong protoc being used and typcally the one comes with anaconda.


fix by

.. code-block:: shell

  which protoc

.. code-block:: shell

  protoc --version

.. code-block:: shell

  conda uninstall protobuf

.. code-block:: shell

  rm $(which protoc)

Then install the correct protoc.
