DAOROOT and DAODATA
===================

DAO is built around two main enviromental variables DAOROOT and DAODATA. These variables are used to locate the installation directory and the data directory, respectively. The DAOROOT variable points to the root directory of the DAO installation, while the DAODATA variable points to the directory where data files are stored. These variables are essential for the proper functioning of DAO and should be set correctly in your environment.
